# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Testing

- Use the `node:test` framework and `assert` for assertions.
- When generating tests, add them to the existing test file for the relevant module.
- Use a new describe block if the function being tested does not already have one.
- Follow existing conventions for test names, structure, and assertions.
